# CS3.6-CW-Development
A-Level - CW Development
I designed a shift management/booking system for my part-time job. As this was for coursework, it was never deployed in a real environment, given that the technologies used are not a viable option. (It could potentially be redesigned in the future to create a deployable product.) However, this system was tested using real-data and completed all core functionality.

This is the repository containing the code behind my A-Level Coursework development, including the GitHub project, which was used to track bugs.
Most of the code is based on the prototype; however, it does include some substantial improvements/changes, including a change of data structures.
This was the final stage of my coursework when it was handed in.
This coursework has supporting documentation documenting the development process, including Analysis, Design, Prototyping, Development, Testing and final reflections on the project.
